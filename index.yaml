  # This index.yaml is automatically updated whenever the dev_appserver
  # detects that a new type of query is run.  If you want to manage the
  # index.yaml file manually, remove the above marker line (the line
  # saying "# AUTOGENERATED").  If you want to manage some indexes
  # manually, move them above the marker line.  The index.yaml file is
  # automatically uploaded to the admin console when you next deploy
  # your application using appcfg.py.
